# custommediaplayer
Everything in here is up for discussion and subject to change depending on input from anyone interested.

The idea is basically the placement of buttons on video and music players aren't always in the places you want and don't have the features you want and may even have features you don't care about so why not give the user the ability to have full control of which buttons they have on screen and where they are placed.

Project desciption: Fully customizable media player (I'm thinking drag and drop) that is cross-platform (mobile and desktop) built with Ionic framework (subject to change)
